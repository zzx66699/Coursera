## 1. Data visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data.   

The McCandless Method  
Information: the data you are working with  
Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept  
Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual  
Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

## 2. Correlation charts
show relationships among data   
Correlation charts show causation can be effective, but don’t necessarily reveal an instance of causation  
### 2.1 Correlation & Causation
Correlation:  
the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other.    
if one variable goes up and the other variable also goes up, it is a positive correlation.   
If one variable goes up and the other variable goes down, it is a negative or inverse correlation.   
If one variable goes up and the other variable stays about the same, there is no correlation.  

Causation:  
causation/ cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome  

### 2.2 Scatterplot
Scatterplots show relationships between different variables. Scatterplots are typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed.

### 2.3 Heatmap

### 2.4 treemap

## 3. Line chart
A line chart is used to track changes over short and long periods of time.  

### 3.1 Horizontal bar charts
If the values being compared are vastly different, a column chart might be too tall. You can use a horizontal bar chart instead.

### 3.2 Area 
area charts allow you to track changes in value across multiple categories of data.   
Individual data points for a changing variable are connected with a continuous line and the area under the line is filled in

## 4. Column chart 
Column charts use size to contrast and compare two or more values, using height or lengths to represent the specific values.   
### 4.1 Ranked bar charts

### 4.2 stacked bar charts

## 5. Combo chart

## 6. Pie chart
The pie chart is a circular graph that is divided into segments representing proportions corresponding to the quantity it represents, especially when dealing with parts of a whole.  

### 6.1 Donut charts

## 7. Distribution graph
A distribution graph displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.

### 7.1 Histograms
illustrate How often data values fall into certain ranges

## 8. Elements of arts
### 8.1 Line
add visual form to your data and help build the structure for your visualization.

### 8.2 Shape
Shapes and visualizations should always be two-dimensional  

### 8.3 Color
The hue of a color is basically its name, red, green, blue and so on.  
Intensity is how bright or dull a color is  
The value is how light or dark the colors are in a visualization.   
Dark values with some black added are called shades of color  
Light values with white added are called tints

### 8.4 Space

### 8.5 Movement

## 9. 5 phases of the design thinking process
A data analyst makes sure that they approach problems in a user-centric way
### 9.1 Emphasize 
think about the emotions and needs of the target audience of your data viz, whether it's stakeholders, team members or the general public  

### 9.2 Define
Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data

### 9.3 Ideate
Generating ideas for data visualization

### 9.4 Prototype
Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback

### 9.5 Test
Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

## 10. Considerations of visualization
headline  
subtitle  
label  
legend  
annotation 注释

## 11. key elements of effective visualizations 
sophisticated use of contrast 对比度的复杂使用  
refined execution 精细化执行  
clear meaning  

## 12. diverging palette 调色板
A diverging palette displays two ranges of values using color intensity to indicate magnitude.  

## 13. 5 tip of compelling presentation
### 13.1 characters
The characters are the people affected by your story.   
This could be your stakeholders, customers, clients, and others.   
When adding information about your characters to your story, you have a great opportunity to include a personal account and bring more human context to the facts that the data has revealed—think about why they care.   

### 13.2 setting
describes what's going on, how often it's happening, what tasks are involved, and other background information about the data project that describes the current situation.  

### 13.3 plot
The plot, sometimes called the conflict, is what creates tension in the current situation. This could be a challenge from a competitor, an inefficient process that needs to be fixed, or a new opportunity that the company just can't pass up. This complication of the current situation should reveal the problem your analysis is solving and compel the characters to act. 

### 13.4 big reveal
resolution, is how the data has shown that you can solve the problem the characters are facing by becoming more competitive, improving a process, inventing a new system, or whatever the ultimate goal of your data project may be. 

### 13.5 aha moment
is when you share your recommendations and explain why you think they'll help your company be successful.

## 14. Difference between copy&paste, link and embed
### 14.1 copy&paste
When you copy and paste a visual into your presentation, you can edit it directly within your slideshow. If your visual or its data points exist in other places, such as a Tableau dashboard, any changes you make will not affect them there.  

### 14.2 link
your visuals will be updated if the original dataset changes  
the visual lives within its original file, and the slideshow connects to it with the visual's URL. Because the two files are now linked, when you make changes to the original file, say a spreadsheet, the changes will automatically appear in your presentation  

### 14.3 embed
an embedded object also lives in the original source file, but the difference is that it doesn't get automatically updated if the source file changes. The embedded copy is completely independent. Similarly, you can make changes to it in your presentation without affecting the visual or data points from the original source file.

## 16. MacCandless Method
1. Introduce the graphic by name  
2. answer obvious questions before they are asked  
3. state the insight of your graphic  
4. call out data to support that insight  
5. tell your audience why it matters  

## 17. Tips of presenting 
Include a title, subtitle, and date  
Use a logical sequence of slides  
Provide an agenda with a timeline  
Limit the amount of text on slides. Your audience should be able to scan each block of text on your slides within 5 seconds  
Start with the business task. Focus on the business task and frame the information in the context of the business task.  
Establish the initial hypothesis  
Show what business metrics you used  
Use visualizations  
Introduce the graphic by name  
Provide a title for each graph  
Go from the general to the specific  
Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points  
Include key takeaways
