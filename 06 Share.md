Data visualization is the graphical representation of data.   

The McCandless Method  
Information: the data you are working with  
Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept  
Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual  
Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

## 2. Correlation charts
show relationships among data   
Correlation charts show causation can be effective, but donâ€™t necessarily reveal an instance of causation  
### 2.1 Correlation & Causation
Correlation:  
the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other.    
if one variable goes up and the other variable also goes up, it is a positive correlation.   
If one variable goes up and the other variable goes down, it is a negative or inverse correlation.   
If one variable goes up and the other variable stays about the same, there is no correlation.  

Causation:  
causation/ cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome  

### 2.2 Scatterplot
Scatterplots show relationships between different variables. Scatterplots are typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed.

### 2.3 Heatmap

## 3. Line chart
A line chart is used to track changes over short and long periods of time.  
### 3.1 Time Series charts

## 4. Column chart 
Column charts use size to contrast and compare two or more values, using height or lengths to represent the specific values.   
### 4.1 Ranked bar charts

### 4.2 stacked bar charts

## 6. Pie chart
The pie chart is a circular graph that is divided into segments representing proportions corresponding to the quantity it represents, especially when dealing with parts of a whole.  

## 7. Distribution graph
A distribution graph displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.

## 8. Elements of arts
### 8.1 Line

### 8.2 Shape
Shapes and visualizations should always be two-dimensional  

### 8.3 Color
The hue of a color is basically its name, red, green, blue and so on.  
Intensity is how bright or dull a color is  
The value is how light or dark the colors are in a visualization.
