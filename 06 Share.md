## 1. Data visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data.   

The McCandless Method  
Information: the data you are working with  
Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept  
Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual  
Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

## 2. Correlation charts
show relationships among data   
Correlation charts show causation can be effective, but don’t necessarily reveal an instance of causation  
### 2.1 Correlation & Causation
Correlation:  
the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other.    
if one variable goes up and the other variable also goes up, it is a positive correlation.   
If one variable goes up and the other variable goes down, it is a negative or inverse correlation.   
If one variable goes up and the other variable stays about the same, there is no correlation.  

Causation:  
causation/ cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome  

### 2.2 Scatterplot
Scatterplots show relationships between different variables. Scatterplots are typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed.

### 2.3 Heatmap

### 2.4 treemap

## 3. Line chart
A line chart is used to track changes over short and long periods of time.  
### 3.1 Time Series charts

### 3.2 Area 
area charts allow you to track changes in value across multiple categories of data.

## 4. Column chart 
Column charts use size to contrast and compare two or more values, using height or lengths to represent the specific values.   
### 4.1 Ranked bar charts

### 4.2 stacked bar charts

## 5. Combo chart

## 6. Pie chart
The pie chart is a circular graph that is divided into segments representing proportions corresponding to the quantity it represents, especially when dealing with parts of a whole.  

## 7. Distribution graph
A distribution graph displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.

### 7.1 Histograms
illustrate How often data values fall into certain ranges

## 8. Elements of arts
### 8.1 Line
add visual form to your data and help build the structure for your visualization.

### 8.2 Shape
Shapes and visualizations should always be two-dimensional  

### 8.3 Color
The hue of a color is basically its name, red, green, blue and so on.  
Intensity is how bright or dull a color is  
The value is how light or dark the colors are in a visualization.   
Dark values with some black added are called shades of color  
Light values with white added are called tints

## 9. 5 phases of the design thinking process
A data analyst makes sure that they approach problems in a user-centric way
### 9.1 Emphasize 
think about the emotions and needs of the target audience of your data viz, whether it's stakeholders, team members or the general public  

### 9.2 Define
Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data

### 9.3 Ideate
Generating ideas for data visualization

### 9.4 Prototype
Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback

### 9.5 Test
Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them
