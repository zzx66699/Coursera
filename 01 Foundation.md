## 3. Three components of Data science
Machine learning, Statistics and Analytics  
These are separated by how many decisions you know you want to make before you begin with them.   
If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics.   
If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.   
If you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What you're looking for is inspiration? Yknowns. That is analytics.

## 4. Five sets of analytical skills 
analytical skills: The qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts  

#### curiosity:

The analytical skill that involves breaking processes down into smaller steps and working with them in an orderly, logical way  

#### understanding context: 
The analytical skill that has to do with how you group things into categories   

#### data design: 
The analytical skill that involves how you organize information  

#### data strategy:
